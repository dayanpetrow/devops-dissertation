It's not just a way to make things faster, a way to automate. It's a way to improve things that at first glance cannot be improved. Devops is like an overthinking mind. This mind is looking to solve the problem by making sure that there are no holes in the approach, that everything goes smoothly without third party interference. This is hard to achieve sometimes. Sometimes you know how to solve the problem and you have the capacity to do so,however there are branches on the road that are there to trip you. Yak shaving is what I'm referring to and devops is full of it. You have task, you think you can solve it in a day, but it takes you months because this task includes another hundred tasks that you have to solve . This is the biggest drawback devops in my opinion. \n\nEven though I think that Devops extends Agile, I also think that it can replace it in the near future.",
